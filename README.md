# Controlling-6-ServoMotors-RestaurantRobot-sArm
This project aims to design and program the circuit that control the movements of the robot's arms. Each arm contains three joints and each joint attached with a servo motor. So, a total of six servo motors will be controlled. Servo motors are wiedly used in robotic projects due to their ability of rotating with specific angles. These angles represent the position of the shoulder, the elbow and the wrist of each arm when the robot is powered. The project is made on Proteus 8 (see my previous repository to download the arduino library https://github.com/Roba-Osylan/Controlling-DC.Motors-L298-Arduino-Proteus). 

The circuit shown below is quite simple. The components used are: 
-Arduino Uno.
-6x Servo Motors.
-2x 5V battery one for the Arduino and the other for the servo motors (3 used in the simulation for organization porpuse).
